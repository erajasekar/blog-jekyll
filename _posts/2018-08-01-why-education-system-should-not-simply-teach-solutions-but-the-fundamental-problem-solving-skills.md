*(Illustrated using a story of how I taught my kid to make 10 year calendar using less than 10 Pages)*

Why we should not teach simply the solutions to the problems, instead teach kids the fundamental problem solving skills?

How to create 10 year calendar with less that 10 pages?

Wondering how these two questions are related?

I will share how I taught my 7 year old daughter to make 10 year calendar with less than 10 pages. Then, I will answer why we should not teach simply the solutions to problems by explaining reasoning behind my teaching approach.

I will also discuss few fundamental skills our education system should teach and what can we change in Math education.

## How I taught creating 10 year calendar with less than pages?

The conversation I had with my daughter.



> **I:** How long is one year’s calendar ?

> **Daughter :** There are 12 months. So It will be 12 pages.

> **I:** How long will be a 10 year’s calendar ?

> **Daughter:** Hmm.. that is 10 times 12, so it will be 120 pages.

> **I:** But, we can make 10 year calendar in less than 10 pages.

> **Daughter:** (with excitement) How?

> **I:** To do that, we need to do a calendar research to identify patterns.

> **Daughter:** How can I do that?
