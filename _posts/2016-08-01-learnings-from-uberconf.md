# Learnings from Uberconf - 2016 
 I got to attend the wonderful technical conference - [uberconf](https://uberconf.com/) and I would like share summary of my learnings in this post. 
 
## Feedback about the uberconf
       
 Before I jump on to the summary sessions, let me share my impression about the conference. This is one the best technical conference I ever attended. I tweeted

 The best thing I liked about the conference is that the sessions are 1.5 hours long that gave us enough time to learn deep-dive and learn the subject. Also the some of the longer subjects are split into two parts so that we can learn them in depth and do some hands on work.  The speakers are not only experts on their subject, they are good mentors and presented their sessions more engaging style.
         
 The only complaint, I can tell is that we are given only audio recordings of the session to listen after the conference. It would be have been great if video recordings are available after the conference.
