# Learnings from Uberconf - 2016 
 I got to attend the wonderful technical conference - [uberconf](https://uberconf.com/) and I would like share summary of my learnings in this post. 
 
## Feedback about the uberconf
       
 Before I jump on to the summary sessions, let me share my impression about the conference. This is one the best technical conference I ever attended. I tweeted 
      
 > Uninterrupted flow of food for mind and body.   
 
 The best thing I liked about the conference is that the sessions are 1.5 hours long that gave us enough time to learn deep-dive and learn the subject. Also the some of the longer subjects are split into two parts so that we can learn them in depth and do some hands on work.  The speakers are not only experts on their subject, they are good mentors and presented their sessions more engaging style.
         
 The only complaint, I can tell is that we are given only audio recordings of the session to offline listen after the conference. It would be have been great if video recordings are available after the conference.

###  Twelve ways to make code suck less by [Venkat Subramanium](https://twitter.com/venkat_s)

* **12. Schedule Time to Lower Technical Debts :**  if technical debt is not payed back, we’ll end up with technical bankruptcy.
* **11. Favor high cohesion:** Narrow, focused, does only one thing well
* **10. Favor Loose Coupling:** Tight coupling make code hard to extend hard to test
* **09. Program with Intention:** Rules for simple design: *Passes the tests , Reveals intention, No duplication , Fewest elements.*
* **08. Avoid Primitive Obsession:** Favor Functional code over imperative.
* **07.  Prefer Clear Code over Clever Code:**
* **06. Apply Zinsser's Principle on Writing:** Great timeless book On writing well by Zinsser's for writing english. But very well applies to code. Principles are Simplicity , Clarity, Brevity, Humanity
* **05. Comment Why, not What:** Use comments to describle its purpose and constraints. Do’t use commenting as substitue for good code.
* **04. Avoid long methods**
* **03. Apply SLAP** A method should have singly level of abstraction.
* **02. Do tactical code reviews:** Peer reviews catch 60% of defects.
* **01. Reduce State & State Mutation :** Messing with state is the root of many problems.
