# Learnings from Uberconf - 2016 
 I got to attend the wonderful technical conference - [uberconf](https://uberconf.com/) and I would like share summary of my learnings in this post. 
 
  ## Feedback about the uberconf
       
 Before I jump on the training sessions, let me share my feedback about the conference. This is one the best technical conference I ever attended. I tweeted

 The best thing I liked about the conference is that the sessions are 1.5 hours long that gave us enough time to learn deep-dive and learn the subject. Also the some of the longer subjects are split into two parts so that we can learn them in depth and do some hands on sessions.
