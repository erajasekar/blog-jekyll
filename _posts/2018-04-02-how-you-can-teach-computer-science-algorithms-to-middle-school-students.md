This is second part of my article about teaching computer science at Community Montessori School, Tampa. In [previous article]({% post_url 2018-04-01-what-middle-school-students-need-to-know-about-computer-science-and-software-engineering-job %}) , I shared what I taught about computer science and software engineering job. In this article, I will write about how I taught computer science algorithms to 7 to 9th grade students.

## How I prepared?

I introduced flowcharts to them so that they could learn to represent algorithms.
