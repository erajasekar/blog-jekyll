This is the third part of my article about teaching computer science at Community Montessori School, Tampa.

In [previous article]({% post_url 2018-04-02-how-you-can-teach-computer-science-algorithms-to-middle-school-students %}), I shared how I taught computer science algorithms. In this article, I will write about how I taught python programming to 7 to 9th grade students.

## How I prepared?
Since I already taught them [Search algorithms]({% post_url 2018-04-02-how-you-can-teach-computer-science-algorithms-to-middle-school-students %}) and guessing number game algorithm in previous session. I wanted to teach them just enough python programming to turn those algorithms to python code.
