We are all born with boundless creativity, But Are we educating people out of their creative capacities? If schools are undermining our creativity, what can be done about it? Inspired by Sir Ken Robinson’s famous TED talk,  I will share my thoughts based on what I learnt about education and creativity.

## Introduction
Sir Ken Robinson's [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity)  *Do Schools Kill Creativity?* is the most popular TED talk and has about 45 million views at the time of my writing this. Ken Robinson makes a good case on Schools kill children’s innate creative talents, But in [EducationBookCast](http://educationbookcast.libsyn.com/podcast/42-do-schools-kill-creativity-by-sir-ken-robinson) Stanislaw Pstrokonski argues against it and rips apart Ken Robinson’s ideas. I will write about my views in this post.

## Why do we become less creative as we grow older?
**Ken Robison says:**

> We know that if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original. Kids are not frightened to be wrong. But We stigmatize mistakes, so by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. We're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities.  

I think the root problem is evaluation and grading system in schools. Grading promotes fear of failure and  create a preference for the easiest possible task.  So kids will no longer explore, but just learn for grades.  Moreover,  Grades tend to diminish students’ interest in whatever they’re learning. Author Alfie Kohn pushes for strong [case against grading](http://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/) .  So grading should be eliminated at least until high school.

## What role schools would have played in Shakespeare’s creative writing?
Ken Robinson refers to Shakespeare as an example and indirectly says his school would not have recogonized his talents.

Stanislaw in  [EducationBookCast](http://educationbookcast.libsyn.com/podcast/42-do-schools-kill-creativity-by-sir-ken-robinson)  points out that ideas employed by  Ken Robinson contradicts with what Shakespeare expert Rex Gibson Says in the book Shakespeare’s Language:

> Shakespeare is an outstanding example of how schooling can foster talent. Schoolboys learned by heart over 100 figures of rhetoric. His schooling provided an excellent resource for the future playwright. Everything Shakespeare learned at school he used in some way in his plays. Having mastered the rules of language, he was able to break and transform them. On this evidence, Shakespeare’s education has been seen as an argument for the value of memorising and of constant practice.  

I think to be creative in a any field, you will first need to acquire skills and knowledge required to be expert of the subject. Kids should utilize the deliberate practice  and hard work that school system demands to gain mastery over field. Remember that

> There is no way to get around the fact that mastery requires a volume of work.  

## Could degrees become not worth anything in future?
Ken Robinson says:

We are going through the process of academic inflation, where you would now need a masters or even PhD for the job that required undergraduate degree previously. Suddenly, degrees aren’t worth anything.

In future, just having a degree itself won’t be enough to get a good job. What a student does based on his own interest  outside of college will really be important. Salman Khan, the founder of [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) proposes, Academic achievement in every field should include a portfolio of creative work in his [One World SchoolHouse: Education Reimagined book](http://www.amazon.com/The-One-World-Schoolhouse-Reimagined/dp/1455508381/) . Here is the expert from the book:

> This brings me to the idea of the ‘creative portfolio’ as a central part of a student’s transcript. if we fail to take a serious look at what students have created on their own, above and beyond the lessons and tests, we miss an opportunity to appreciate what is truly special about them. More than any data, grades, or assessment, someone’s actual creative product is the best testament of his or her ability to create from scratch, to make a solution out of an open ended problem.
