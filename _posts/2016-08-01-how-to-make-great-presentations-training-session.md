# How to make great presentations for a training session 
I observed effective methods used to make a excellent presention while attending uberconf - software technical conference.  I will share some of the best practices and tips to create a outstanding presentation a for training session. 
 
 **1. Communicate  the Goal.**
State one or all of the following.

* Objective of the presentation
* Agenda of what will be covered in the presentation.
* What will be the takeway at end of the presentation.

**2. Try to Start with an exercise**

* It can be as simple as stating a problem, situation or a use case related to the topic ask participants to write about it.
* For example If presentation is about software architecture fundamentals
	+ State a business problem and ask participants to identify which architecuture characteristics (like scalability, reliability, responsive, etc) need to be satisifed to solve the problem.
* Depending on number of attendees, ask them to form a group for couple of people.
* This not only creates audience engagement, but prepares their mind to think about the topic.
* If participants are unknown to each other, it also helps them to introduce each other and socialize.
* If possible, re-visit the exercise towards end of the session to show that they can now better solve the exercise after learning through the session.


**3. Answer Key questions in Introduction**

* In Introduction answer the the questions like
	+ ***what ?*** - definition of topic
    + ***why ?*** this topic is important 
    + ***how ?*** we can do something.
* Example for topic Software Architecuture fundamentals.
	+ What is software architecture?
    + Why software architecture is important?
    + How to design good architectural solution?

**4. Properly organize  the material**

* Make sure the content is well organized into sections and there is natural flow of one section to next.
* If each section is linked to one another with logical reasoning, it's easy to recollect the entire content from begining,
* Example for topic Software architecture fundamentals? 
	+ What is Architecture?
    + Why software architecture is important ?
    + How to design good architectural solution?
      + Transforming business requirements to architecture characteristics
      + Various Architecture patterns and how it influences architecture characteristics.
      + Pitfalls and antipatterns.
    + Summary.
* It should pretty much be told like a story.
* Today stories are typically narrated with many suprises to keep audience attention. But rather than surprises, throw them an open question and tell them that you will get to answer at end of the session or they will able to figure it out themselves as a result of the learning,
* Example on Software architecuture training.
	+ Present the a business requirement and a architecute (It should have some flaws, but should not be obvious)  and ask them what is wrong with this architecture? Pause momentorily, But don't wait for answer. Tell them we will get to it at the end.
 	+ Towards end,  Present the same business requirement again ask if they can identify the flaws and and come up with better architecture.
    
**5. How to keep audience engaged?**

* Tell a funny joke
* Tell a short story. 
* Show some funny pictures 
* Play some funny or interesting video related to topic.

**6. Tips to Make it stick**

* Use analogies whenever possible. Analogies helps to associate new concepts with already familiar things. So it makes it very easy remember.
* Use famous quotes from other people.
* Convey single message / tagline about the topic. 
* Give some handouts to takeaway.
* Use live demo when possible.
* Provide hands on exercises to practice when possible.
