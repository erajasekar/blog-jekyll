I taught a cool mind reading trick to my daughter and she loved playing it. It is based on math and computer science fundamentals and it has something interesting things to teach kids of any age 3 or even 13. I'll share the trick, concepts behind it and the things we can teach kids using it.
<br>

## Lets play the game

 

## What's the secret trick?

Try this demo that reveals the trick.

So just add numbers in last row for selected columns to find the number. Simple enough. Are you curious how it works?

## How does it work?

As you have noticied, the numbers in last row are powers of 2, because this trick is based on binary number system. Assume each column represent a binary digit ( 0 or 1 ) and 5 columns can make up a 5 bit binary. Then we'll add each number to a column only if binary representation of that number has 1 for corresponding column. This demo helps you to visualize it. Use slider to increament the number and watch how each number gets filled in. As a 5 bin binary can represent 1 to 31 in decimal numbers, we can use upto number 31.

Basically, we will be converting decimal number to binary to fill in the table and coverting binary to decimal while find the number.

## Adapting it based on kids age

### Younger kids.

You can just write this table in paper to play with kids. If your kid can remember column number (16,8,4,2,1) in mind, you can shuffle the numbers within column to make it tricker

### Elder kids.

If kids can write, we should encourage them to make this table by themselves. You can tell them the instructions like this.

> We will be writing numbers 1 to 30 using addition. We can only pick numbers 16,8,4,2,1 to add together and find a way to get resulting sum for any number. we can add 2 or 3 or 4 or even 5 numbers together. For eg. 
> Let's put 1 under 1. 
> we have 2, so we can put 2 under 2.
> We don't have 3, so How can we make 3 ?
> Just add 2 and 1. So put 3 under 2 and 1.
> we have 4, so we can put 4 under 4.
> We don't have 5, but we have 4, what is needed to make 5 from 4.
> We can add 4 and 1 to make 5. So lets put 5 under 4 and 1.
> We don't have 6, but we have 4, what is needed to make 6 from 4.
> We can add 4 and 2 to make 6. So lets put 5 under 4 and 2.
> We don't have 7, so How can we make 7 ? Remember we can even add 3 numbers together.
> We just got 6 by adding 4 and 2. So we can simply add 1 to make 7. So lets put 7 under 4,2,1.
> keep going.

## What can we teach kids from this?

### What younger kids can learn from this?
* Addition
* Teaches addtion multiple numbers gradually from 2 and up to 5. 
* Tracking a previous result in mind and continuing calculation is a important skill they will learn by adding multiple numbers at same time.
* Contraints and rules, they have to pick from only numbers 1,2,4,8,16. working through a problem under given constraints is a good skill they will learn.
* Substraction
### What we can teach to Elder kids?
* Introduce binary numbers and binary number system KB, MB, GB similar to decimal number system tens, hundred, thousands, millions.
* Connect with real world examples, memory capacities of phones and devices actual refer to binary number system.
* Tell them entire digital devices knowns only 0,1 and does everything using binary operations.
* Explain why modern digital world is based on binary. It's because of all be hardware is made form wonderful material silicon which is great semiconductor. It can easily change state between 0 ( stop conducting) and 1 ( start conducting ) electricity through them.
