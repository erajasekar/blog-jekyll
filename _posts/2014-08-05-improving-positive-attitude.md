I wrote about [Happiness Advantage Book](http://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Advantage-Principles-Psychology-Performance-ebook/dp/B003F3PMYI) in my [earlier post](../../happiness-advantage/) and the book suggests following exercise to improve your positive attitude.

> The best way to kick-start this is to start making a daily list of the good things in your job, your career, and your life. It may sound hokey, or ridiculously simple— and indeed the activity itself is simple— but over a decade of empirical studies has proven the profound effect it has on the way our brains are wired. When you write down a list of “three good things” that happened that day, your brain will be forced to scan the last 24 hours for potential positives— things that brought small or large laughs, feelings of accomplishment at work, a strengthened connection with family, a glimmer of hope for the future. In just five minutes a day, this trains the brain to become more skilled at noticing and focusing on possibilities for personal and professional growth, and seizing opportunities to act on them.

The book also narrates very interesting experiment done on the ***luck factor*** by [Richard Wiseman](http://www.amazon.com/The-Luck-Factor-Essential-Principles/dp/1401359418) and what he found was

> it turns out that there is no such thing—in a scientific sense, at least— as luck. The only difference (and it is a big one) is whether or not people think that they are lucky— in essence, whether they expect good or bad things to happen to them.
