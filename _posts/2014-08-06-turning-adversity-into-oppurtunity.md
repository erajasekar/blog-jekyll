The book [Happiness Advantage](http://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Advantage-Principles-Psychology-Performance-ebook/dp/B003F3PMYI) suggests the trick to turn adversity into opportunity is to realize that there always exists a path that leads us from failure or setback to a place where we are even stronger and more capable than before the fall.

Success is more about using that downward momentum to propel ourselves in the opposite direction. Itâ€™s about capitalizing on setbacks and adversity to become even happier, even more motivated, and even more successful.
