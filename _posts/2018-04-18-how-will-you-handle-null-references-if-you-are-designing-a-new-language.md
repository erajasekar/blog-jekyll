The nullable objects introduces a fundamental problem with type system. For e.g If you declare a object as String, it doesnâ€™t guarantee that the value is real String or null.

We normally skip null checks based on our assumptions in control flow of code. But when we are wrong, the code crashes with Null Pointer Exception. Java 8 introduced Optionals to deal with Nullable objects. But it has some flaws

## Why Java Optionals is not a great way to handle nulls?
