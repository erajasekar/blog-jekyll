We have heard about **law of karma** or *cause and effect*. Every action we do generates a force of energy that returns to us in kind. If we had committed bad actions in past (or in previous birth) inevitably that will bring bad consequences in present life.

My brother wrote an article about [Astrology and Theory of Karma](http://innovativeastrosolutions.wordpress.com/2014/03/31/astrology-and-theory-of-karma/).
This is follow up to that article providing spiritual answer to how to deal with influences of bad karma based on my learnings from ***Bhagavad Gita*** and ***Seven Spiritual Laws of Success Book***


###How can we deal with influences of past Karma?

There are three things you can do about past karma.
<br>
####1. Pay your karmic debts

Most people just do this ***unconsciously***. Sometimes there will be sufferings involved in the payment those debts. But if we understand law of karma, we can make some *conscious decisions* that can reduce sufferings.

####2. Tranform your karma into more desirable experience

This is a very interesting process in which you ask yourself :- What can I learn from this experience? Why is this happening and what is the message that the universe is giving to me? How can I make this experience useful to my fellow human beings? Then, deliberately act in such a way as to counteract the evil effects of past deeds. By doing this, you can sow seed of opportunity for creating new positive karma which can bring you goodness.
 
For eg. This can be little things like when you are hit by a stone in your path, you can clear it away so that it won't hurt someone else. 

Or can be big things like if you are experiencing a serious health problem, you can create awareness or help others facing same disease. Infact people do this, many of the volunteer organizations for creating awareness, raising funds for dreadful diseases are actually started by people who suffered by those diseases. (like [Leukemia Lymphoma Society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia_%26_Lymphoma_Society#History))

This way, while paying your karmic debt, you will have also converted the adversity into a benefit that may bring you positive effects.

####3. Transcend your karma

Transcending Karma can be very hard, but can be done through spirituality and meditation. In the case of an ordinary, unambitious person, karmic dispensation is unavoidable, inevitable.
But, there is something called divine grace. Suppose I was ignorant and I did a few things wrong. 
If I shed bitter tears and cry for forgiveness, then naturally God's compassion will dawn on me. 
When a person enters into the spiritual life, his karma can be nullified if it is the Will of God operating through a spiritual Master.
Slowly God's infinite grace can nullify the results of his bad karma.

Like many practices of a spiritual nature, this is easier said than done and requires it extreme devotion.

Here is quotes from teachings of ***Lord Sri Krishna Paramatma*** in *Chapter 18 Freedom & Renunciation*

>Make every act an offering to me; regard me as your only protector. Relying on interior discipline, meditate on me always.- **versus 57**.

>Remembering me, you shall overcome all difficulties through my grace. But if you will not heed me in your self-will, nothing will avail you.
>- **versus 58**.


>Be aware of me always, adore me, make every act an offering to me, and you shall come to me; this I promise; for you are dear to me.- **versus 65**.

>Abandon all supports and look to me for protection. I shall purify you from the sins of the past; do not grieve.
>- **versus 66**.
