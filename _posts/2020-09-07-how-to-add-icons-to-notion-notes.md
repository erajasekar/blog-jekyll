## Problem with Adding Icons in Notion

 Notion comes with only limited set of icons. We can get beautiful icons from many websites like [Icon8](https://icons8.com/) , [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/). But it is painful to add icons from those websites to Notion notes. So I have built a [Notion Icons](https://notion.erajasekar.com/) tool to easily add icons to Notion. 

 In this post, I will share how to use Notions Icons and some tips in using Icons in Notion.

## Tips and Best Practices

I would like to share some tips and best practices I found while organizing notes with Icons. 

### 1. Use templates to automatically add icons for new Database Items.

You must be already familiar with Notion templates to easily replicate page structures in Database. If you are not, check this [article](https://www.notion.so/Database-templates-454ed5ab5bd24226b58d176697bd7e10). 
Using templates, we can easily set default values for fields including Icons.

### 2. Use unique colors for each category

I use popular [PARA](https://youtu.be/FZIMlWLW4gU) ( Projects, Areas, Resources, Archieve ) method to organize all resources. So I use unique color for each type of resource.
For eg. Green for Projects, Red for Areas, Blue for Resources etc. Here is example from my Notion.

Even if you don't use PARA, if gives a quick visual context if you use unique color for each category.

### 3. Use same icon for each item in the collection

The database view will look neat if you use same icon for each item in the database. Also, when you use same icon, you can set it as default icon in templates and save lot of time.


You can see below screen shot of my setup and I have used same icons for all vidoes, podcasts, books etc.

### 4. Use different icon for each item for tag database.

I use global databases for Topics, Tags to categorize notes. For those items, It's a good idea to use unique icons based on the name. Here is example from my Notion setup.

## Don't find the Icons you want ?

I have only added Icons I use in My Notion. More icons we add, it becomes harder to choose right one ( [Paradox Of Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice) ). I would like to crowd source best Icons for Notion from the community. So feel free to contribute more icons by following these [instructions](https://notion.erajasekar.com/about/#how-to-contribute).
