We have heard about **law of karma** or *cause and effect*. Every action we do generates a force of energy that returns to us in kind. If we had committed bad actions in past (or in previous birth) inevitably that will bring bad consequences in present life.

My brother wrote an article about [Astrology and Theory of Karma](http://innovativeastrosolutions.wordpress.com/2014/03/31/astrology-and-theory-of-karma/).
This is follow up on that article providing spiritual answer to how to deal with influences of bad karma based on learnings from [Seven Spiritual Laws of Success Book](http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Spiritual-Laws-Success-Fulfillment-ebook/dp/B005BY3XHC/)

###How can we deal with influences of past Karma?

There are three things you can do about past karma.

####1. Pay your karmic debts

Most people just do this ***unconsciously***. Sometimes there will be sufferings involved in the payment those debts. But if we understand law of karma, we can make some *conscious decisions* that can reduce sufferings.

####2. Tranform your karma into more desirable experience

This is a very interesting process in which you ask yourself :- What can I learn from this experience? Why is this happening and what is the message that the universe is giving to me? How can I make this experience useful to my fellow human beings? Then, deliberately act in such a way as to counteract the evil effects of past deeds. By doing this, you can sow seed of opportunity for creating new positive karma which can bring you goodness.
 
For eg. This can be little things like when you are hit by a stone in your path, you can clear it away so that it won't hurt someone else. 

Or can be big things like if you are experiencing a serious health problem, you can create awareness or help others facing same disease. Infact people do this, many of the volunteer organizations for creating awareness, raising funds for dreadful diseases are actually started by people who suffered by those diseases. (like [Leukemia Lymphoma Society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia_%26_Lymphoma_Society#History))

This way, while paying your karmic debt, you will have also converted the adversity into a benefit that may bring you positive effects.

####3. Transcend your karma

Transcending Karma can be very hard, but can be done through spirituality and meditation. In the case of an ordinary, unambitious person, karmic dispensation is unavoidable, inevitable.
But, there is something called divine grace. Suppose I was ignorant and I did a few things wrong. 
If I shed bitter tears and cry for forgiveness, then naturally God's compassion will dawn on me. 
When a person enters into the spiritual life, his karma can be nullified if it is the Will of God operating through a spiritual Master.
Slowly God's infinite grace can nullify the results of his bad karma.

Like many practices of a spiritual nature, this is easier said than done and requires it extreme sincerity.

Here is quotes from teachings for Lord Sri Krishna Paramatma in **chapter 18 Freedom & Renunciation**

Versus 57:-
>Make every act an offering to me; regard me as your only protector. Relying on interior discipline, meditate on me always.

Versus 58:-
>Remembering me, you shall overcome all difficulties through my grace. But if you will not heed me in your self-will, nothing will avail you.

Versus 65:-
>Be aware of me always, adore me, make every act an offering to me, and you shall come to me; this I promise; for you are dear to me.

Versus 66:-

>Abandon all supports and look to me for protection. I shall purify you from the sins of the past; do not grieve. - Chapter 18, Versus 66.

Since karma is simple cause and effect or action and reaction, if something happens to you and you just don’t react, you can stop karma in its tracks. Of course, like many practices of a spiritual nature, this is easier said than done. - See more at: http://kundaliniyogabootcamp.com/transcending-karma-just-dont-react/#sthash.ppWMXshX.dpuf

Karma is often referred to as a wheel because it keeps on spinning. Every time something confronts you and you react, it causes another like event or action and then you react again and the hamster wheel keeps spinning until you consciously step off of it by not reacting. Each time you choose not to react, you take back a part of your energy that you once would’ve squandered on emotional outbursts, constant plotting and planning and strategizing over ways to handle some meaningless event. - See more at: http://kundaliniyogabootcamp.com/transcending-karma-just-dont-react/#sthash.ppWMXshX.dpuf

Sri Ramana Maharshi: Yes. If the agent, upon whom the Karma depends, namely the ego, which has come into existence between the body and the Self, merges in its source and loses its form, how can the Karma, which depends upon it, survive? When there is no ‘I’ there is no Karma.

Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer in sacrifice, whatever you give, whatever you practice as austerity, O Arjuna, do it as an offering unto Me.
-Gita, Ch.9, Verse 27.

Thus shall you be freed from the bonds of actions yielding good and evil fruits; with the mind steadfast in the Yoga of renunciation, and liberated, you shall come unto Me.

Make every act an offering to me; regard me as your only protector. Relying
on interior discipline, meditate on me always. 58 Remembering me, you shall overcome all difficulties through my grace. But if you will not heed me in your self-will, nothing will avail you.

Be aware of me always, adore me, make every act an offering to me, and you shall come to me; this I promise; for you are dear to me. 66 Abandon all supports and look to me for protection. I shall purify you from the sins of the past; do not grieve.

But again, there is something called divine grace. Suppose I was ignorant and I did a few things wrong. If I shed bitter tears and cry for forgiveness, then naturally God's compassion will dawn on me. When a person enters into the spiritual life, his karma can easily be nullified if it is the Will of God operating through a spiritual Master. Slowly God's infinite grace can nullify the results of his bad karma and expedite the results of his good karma.
