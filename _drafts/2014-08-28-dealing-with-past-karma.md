We have heard about law of karma or cause and effect. My brother wrote an article about [Astrology and Theory of Karma](http://innovativeastrosolutions.wordpress.com/2014/03/31/astrology-and-theory-of-karma/).
This is follow up on that article providing spritual answer to how to deal with influences of bad karma based on learnings from [Seven Spiritual Laws of Success Book](http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Spiritual-Laws-Success-Fulfillment-ebook/dp/B005BY3XHC/)

***How can we deal with influences of past Karma?***

There are three things you can do about past karma.

*1. Pay your karmic debts*

Most people just do this unconsciously. Sometimes there will be sufferings involved in the payment those debts. But if we understand law of karma, we can make some conscious decisions that can reduce sufferings.

*2. Tranform your karma:* 

This is a very interesting process in which you ask yourself, What can I learn from this experience? Why is this happening and what is the message that the universe is giving to me? How can I make this experience useful to my fellow human beings? By doing this, you look for seed of opportunity for creating new positive karma which can bring you goodness.

For eg. This can be little things like when you are hit by a stone in your path, you can clear it away so that it won't hurt someone else. 

Or can be big things like if you are experiencing a serious health problem, you can create awareness or help others facing same disease. We have seen people doing this, most of the volunteer organizations for creating awarness/collecting funds for dreadful diseases are actually started by people who suffered by those diseases.

This way, while paying your karmic debt, you will have also converted the adversity into a benefit that may bring you possive effects.

**[I am not sure if you write about 3 point as I have not experienced it myself. Let me know your thoughts.]**

*3. Transcend it*

To transcend karma is to become independent of it. This can be very hard, could be done through practise of meditation.
