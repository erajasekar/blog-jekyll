# Highlights of Book - THE 150 HEALTHIEST FOODS ON EARTH: THE SURPRISING, UNBIASED TRUTH ABOUT WHAT YOU SHOULD EAT AND WHY

## General Principles

1. The quality of the food we eat comes from the quality of the food our food eats. 
2. Where a food comes from can make a big difference in its nutritional composition, and how it was produced makes a big difference in its chemical composition. 
3. The more plant foods, the better. 
4. **Eat less sugar. **And eat fewer foods that convert quickly to sugar in the body (read: almost all processed carbohydrates)
5. **Eat Real food**—whole food with minimal processing— contains a virtual pharmacy of nutrients, phytochemicals, enzymes, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, anti- inflammatories, and healthful fats, and can keep you alive and thriving into your tenth decade.
6. How you eat is as important as what you eat. **Mindfulness** and **consciousness** in eating—like in everything else in life—contribute to health and well-being.

### Beets

* > Beets got a bad rap from the low-carb folks because they are high in sugar. That’s true, but not significant unless you’re really, really sugar sensitive. 


### Broccoli

* This superstar vegetable has been lauded for its cancer-fighting power. 
* These vegetables are excellent sources of a family of anticancer phytochemicals called isothiocyanates. Isothiocyanates fight cancer by neutralizing carcinogens—the “bad guys” of the cancer battle.
* Also a nutritional powerhouse that contains potassium, fiber, magnesium, Vitamin C, folate, magnesium, phosphorus, beta-carotene, vitamin A.
* > Broccoli on their 2003 list of twelve foods least contaminated with pesticides which is nice.

### Bok Choy

* This is a member of the brassica family, which means it contains indoles, compounds that have been shown to significantly lower the risk of cancer.
* Not only that, it’s loaded with calcium, potassium, beta-carotene, and vitamin A. 

### Broccoli Rabe

* Broccoli rabe contains flavonoids, sulforaphane, and indoles, which help prevent cellular degeneration and may help protect against cancer. Sulforaphane, for example, has been shown to induce powerful enzymes that protect rodents from tumors.

* Also contains superstars of eye nutrition, lutein and zeaxanthin.

### Cabbage

* In the world of vegetables, the brassica family is true royalty. And the reigning king of the brood—which includes broccoli, kohlrabi, cauliflower, bok choy, Brussels sprouts, and chard—is the cabbage.
* The cabbage family is probably the most important vegetable in the world from the point of view of nutritional benefits and cancer-fighting ability.
* Cabbage Keeps Breast Cancer at Bay.
* Phytochemicals that pack an anticancer wallop and are plentiful in cabbage include dithiolethiones, isothiocynates, and sulforaphane.
* On top of all its phytochemical power, cabbage is a darn good source of everyday vitamins and minerals. It contains calcium, magnesium, potassium, vitamin C, vitamin K, beta-carotene.
* > Many members of the cabbage family contain goitrogens, naturally occurring substances that may interfere with the function of the thyroid gland.

### Carrots

* As little as one carrot a day could possibly cut the rate of lung cancer in half.
* Carrots really are good for your eyes. They’re a great source of lutein and zeaxanthin, two other carotenoids that, when working together, have shown enormous promise in protecting the eyes and helping to prevent macular degeneration and cataracts.
* Carrots contain Calcium, Potassium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, and Vitamin C, and of course, Vitamin A, Also beta-carotene and alpha-carotene. They also have fiber.

* > Carrots got a really bad and totally undeserved rap by the low-carb folks because of their high glycemic index. Actually, the glycemic index isn’t very important—the glycemic load is. The glycemic index tests are done on a 50-g portion of carbohydrate, whereas the load tests are done on real-life portions. A carrot has only about 4 g of carbohydrate, so its glycemic load—the only number that matters—is ridiculously low (about 3 on a scale of 0–40+). You’d have to eat a ton of carrots to get a significant rise in blood sugar. Even so, some very careful diabetes doctors whose opinion I respect still tell patients to beware. For everyone else, I think carrots are absolutely fine.

### Cauliflower

* Similar to cabbage, Cauliflower contains indole, sulforaphane which helps to prevent cancer.
* > Cauliflower also contains purines, a feature it shares with a number of very healthy foods including sardines and spinach. Usually that’s not a problem—we break down purines into uric acid and get rid of it. But in some people the mechanism doesn’t work exactly right; uric acid builds up and causes painful episodes of gout. Such patients are advised to limit foods with purines. Though cauliflower isn’t as superhigh in purines as some other foods, the amount is moderately high, and you should be aware of it.

### Celery
