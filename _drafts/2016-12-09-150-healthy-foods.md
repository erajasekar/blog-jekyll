# Highlights of Book - THE 150 HEALTHIEST FOODS ON EARTH: THE SURPRISING, UNBIASED TRUTH ABOUT WHAT YOU SHOULD EAT AND WHY

## General Principles

1. The quality of the food we eat comes from the quality of the food our food eats. 
2. Where a food comes from can make a big difference in its nutritional composition, and how it was produced makes a big difference in its chemical composition. 
3. The more plant foods, the better. 
4. **Eat less sugar. **And eat fewer foods that convert quickly to sugar in the body (read: almost all processed carbohydrates)
5. **Eat Real food**—whole food with minimal processing— contains a virtual pharmacy of nutrients, phytochemicals, enzymes, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, anti- inflammatories, and healthful fats, and can keep you alive and thriving into your tenth decade.
6. How you eat is as important as what you eat. **Mindfulness** and **consciousness** in eating—like in everything else in life—contribute to health and well-being.

## Vegetables

There are no bad vegetables. But these are identified as ***superstars*** that are loaded with nutrients and has great health benefits.

### Artichokes

* Artichokes Bring Stomach Relief

### Arugula

* Good source of Vitamin  A, Vitamin K 
* Gives us Eye-healthy carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin

### Asparagus

* The asparagus root is also believed to help develop peace of mind, a loving nature, a good memory, and a calm spirit. 
*  In India, it’s used to promote fertility, reduce menstrual cramping, and increase milk production in nursing mothers. 
* High in vitamin K, essential for healthy clotting and for strong bones. Also has Good amount of pottasium and folate 

### Beets

* It's loaded with pottasium and good source of folate and magnesium 
* > Beets got a bad rap from the low-carb folks because they are high in sugar. That’s true, but not significant unless you’re really, really sugar sensitive. 


### Broccoli

* This superstar vegetable has been lauded for its cancer-fighting power. 
* These vegetables are excellent sources of a family of anticancer phytochemicals called isothiocyanates. Isothiocyanates fight cancer by neutralizing carcinogens—the “bad guys” of the cancer battle.
* Also a nutritional powerhouse that contains potassium, fiber, magnesium, Vitamin C, folate, magnesium, phosphorus, beta-carotene, vitamin A.
* > Broccoli on their 2003 list of twelve foods least contaminated with pesticides which is nice.

### Bok Choy

* This is a member of the brassica family, which means it contains indoles, compounds that have been shown to significantly lower the risk of cancer.
* Not only that, it’s loaded with calcium, potassium, beta-carotene, and vitamin A. 

### Broccoli Rabe

* Broccoli rabe contains flavonoids, sulforaphane, and indoles, which help prevent cellular degeneration and may help protect against cancer. Sulforaphane, for example, has been shown to induce powerful enzymes that protect rodents from tumors.
* Great for Healthy Bones and Superb Vision.
* This immune-boosting vegetable packs an incredible nutritions like calcium,  potassium, vitamin C, folate, bone-building vitamin K, vitamin A, beta-carotene. 
* Also contains superstars of eye nutrition, lutein and zeaxanthin.

### Cabbage

* In the world of vegetables, the brassica family is true royalty. And the reigning king of the brood—which includes broccoli, kohlrabi, cauliflower, bok choy, Brussels sprouts, and chard—is the cabbage.
* The cabbage family is probably the most important vegetable in the world from the point of view of nutritional benefits and cancer-fighting ability.
* Cabbage Keeps Breast Cancer at Bay.
* Phytochemicals that pack an anticancer wallop and are plentiful in cabbage include dithiolethiones, isothiocynates, and sulforaphane.
* On top of all its phytochemical power, cabbage is a darn good source of everyday vitamins and minerals. It contains calcium, magnesium, potassium, vitamin C, vitamin K, beta-carotene.
* > Many members of the cabbage family contain goitrogens, naturally occurring substances that may interfere with the function of the thyroid gland. People with hypothyroidism would be wise to consume moderately. In the absence of thyroid problems, there is no research whatsoever to indicate that goitrogenic foods will have any negative impact on your health.

### Carrots

* As little as one carrot a day could possibly cut the rate of lung cancer in half.
* Carrots really are good for your eyes. They’re a great source of lutein and zeaxanthin, two other carotenoids that, when working together, have shown enormous promise in protecting the eyes and helping to prevent macular degeneration and cataracts.
* Carrots contain Calcium, Potassium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, and Vitamin C, and of course, Vitamin A, Also beta-carotene and alpha-carotene. They also have fiber.
* To get the most out of the carotenoids found in carrots, eat them with a little fat. The carotenoids and vitamin A are fat-soluble nutrients and are better absorbed that way.
* > Carrots got a really bad and totally undeserved rap by the low-carb folks because of their high glycemic index. Actually, the glycemic index isn’t very important—the glycemic load is. The glycemic index tests are done on a 50-g portion of carbohydrate, whereas the load tests are done on real-life portions. A carrot has only about 4 g of carbohydrate, so its glycemic load—the only number that matters—is ridiculously low (about 3 on a scale of 0–40+). You’d have to eat a ton of carrots to get a significant rise in blood sugar. Even so, some very careful diabetes doctors whose opinion I respect still tell patients to beware. For everyone else, I think carrots are absolutely fine.

### Cauliflower

* Similar to cabbage, Cauliflower contains indole, sulforaphane which helps to prevent cancer.
* > Cauliflower also contains purines, a feature it shares with a number of very healthy foods including sardines and spinach. Usually that’s not a problem—we break down purines into uric acid and get rid of it. But in some people the mechanism doesn’t work exactly right; uric acid builds up and causes painful episodes of gout. Such patients are advised to limit foods with purines. Though cauliflower isn’t as superhigh in purines as some other foods, the amount is moderately high, and you should be aware of it.

### Celery

* Celery just might be the number-one medicinal food for blood pressure.
* It’s been recommended in traditional Chinese medicine for high blood pressure for centuries, and experimental evidence has confirmed its usefulness.
* Celery is also a great source of silicon, which is getting a lot of attention recently as a very important nutrient for bone health. Because of its silicon content, celery can help renew joints, bones, arteries, and all connective tissue.
* >  Celery is on list of twelve foods most contaminated with pesticides. So you might want to buy organic, or at least wash your celery well in a fruit-and-vegetable wash.

### Collard Greens

* Collards are members of the family of cruciferous vegetables and provide valuable cancer-fighting phytochemicals.
* Collards provides Calciumm, Fiber Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Vitamin C, and a ton of Vitamins A and K. There’s also a good amount of beta-carotene.
### Dandelion

* Dandelion Improves Your Liver and Your Moods Probably at the top of the list of dandelion’s health benefits is its profound effect on the liver.
* Dandelion helps relieving constipation and indigestion.
* Dandelion root is also helpful in the treatment of diabetes.
* It contains Calcium, Potassium, Bone building Vitamin K, and good amount of fiber. 
* > Those with gallstones should consult an herbalist when using dandelion as an herb.           

### Eggplant

* The Nutritional Power of Purple A substance called nasunin has been isolated from that deep purple pigment. Nasunin is a powerful antioxidant.
* > Eggplant contains a substance called solanine. In theory, if solanine is not destroyed in the intestine, it could be toxic. This is generally not an issue, some people with osteoarthritis may not be able to destroy solanine in the gut, leading to solanine absorption and aggravating osteoarthritis.

### Endive

* Endive has Calcium, Potassium, Folate, Vitamin A , Beta-carotene), and bone-strengthening vitamin K

### Fennel
* Fennel helps relieving colic whic is significant problem in infants. So Babies Benefit from fennel seed oil as a colic medicine.
* > Pregnant women should not use fennel oil or fennel extracts. Also, anyone allergic to celery, carrots, dill, or anise should avoid fennel as well.

### Green Beans

* Green beans contain significant amount of folate.
* Green (string) beans has Calcium, Vitamin A, Potassium. Manganese, beta-carotene and the eye-friendly carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, bone-building vitamin K. And also Fiber.

### Horseradish

* Horseradish is a relative of the mustard family that acts as a digestive stimulant.
* It’s also great for clearing up the sinuses! It inhibits bacterial infection.

### Jerusalem Artichokes

* It has fructooligosaccharides and inulin which feeds Good bacteria for a healthy Gut.
* They’re extremely healthy food for the **good** bacteria in your gut.

### Jicama

* Jicama is a low-calorie, low-fat, high-fiber food.
* Jicama also has calcium, magnesium, potassium, vitamin C, vitamin A, and beta-carotene. 

### Kale

*  Kale as number one among the vegetables, with an ORAC ( oxygen radical absorbance capacity) value of 1770 .
*  Like others in the brassica family, it contains powerful phytochemicals like cancer- fighting indoles, plant compounds.
*  Kale is loaded with calcium, iron, and vitamins A, C, and bone-building vitamin K.
*  It contains seven times the beta-carotene of broccoli and ten times as much lutein and zeaxanthin, eye-protecting carotenoids known to help protect against macular degeneration. 
*  It has protein and fiber as well.

### Kohlrabi

* Like its relatives (broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage), kohlrabi contains important phytochemicals such as cancer-fighting indoles, sulforaphane, and isothiocynates. 
* It’s also a good source of vitamin C and an excellent source of potassium.

### Leeks 

* Leeks are also a good source of two of the most important carotenoids for eye health, lutein and zeaxanthin. 
* Leeks also have fiber, calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, vitamin K, and vitamin A.        

### Mushrooms

* The three specific types with the greatest health benefits are Maitake, Shiitake, and Reishi. All three have powerful effects on the immune system, and all three act as medicine.
* Maitake is especially good for counteracting the toxic effects of radiation and chemotherapy, such as extreme fatigue and nausea.    
* Reishi mushrooms appear to be a natural stress-buster. It is the mushroom of choice for people under extreme physical or emotional stress.
* Mushrooms in general also contain a powerful antioxidant called L- ergothioneine.  it seems to act as a metabolic energy enhancer, stimulating the breakdown of sugar in red blood cells and mimicking carnitine in its ability to transport fat into the mitochondria of the cells where the fat can be burned for energy. That’s exactly what most over-the-counter weight loss supplements promise but rarely deliver.

### Okra

*  It’s one of a select group of foods that include naturally occurring glutathione, arguably the most important antioxidant in the body.  It also helps the liver detoxify chemicals.
* Okra’s also a high-fiber food.
* It’s also pretty high in protein.
* Okra is high in calcium, magnesium, potassium, vitamin A, vitamin K, and folic acid.
*  In Ayurvedic medicine, okra is considered “tridoshic,” meaning it is good for balancing all metabolic types.

### Onions

* Onions are a cancer-fighting food.
* Onions Help Build Strong Bones.
* Onions contain powerful antioxidants and are anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, and antiviral. 
* Onions also contain a number of sulfides very similar to those in garlic, which may lower blood lipids and blood pressure.
* > Onions on its 2003 list of twelve foods least contaminated with pesticides. Great!

### Peppers

* Capsaicin peppers are rich in a host of nutrients, including beta-carotene, eye-friendly carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, and vitamin C. Their vitamin C content is probably the reason they have been used as a popular natural remedy for colds and coughs.
* The active ingredient, capsaicin, produces a feeling of warmth when applied to the skin.
* Hot peppers (and their powders) may act as a metabolism booster. 

### Peppers (sweet)

* Nutritionally they’re an excellent source of vitamins C and A (beta-carotene) and the mineral potassium. They also contain vitamin K, which is increasingly coming under scrutiny as a vitally important component of bone health.
* Red peppers contain beta-cryptoxanthin, a carotenoid that may lower the risk of developing lung cancer.
* > Bell peppers on its 2003 list of twelve foods most contaminated with pesticides. So Organic is recommended.

### Pumpkin

* This vegetable that is ridiculously low in calories while very high in potassium and vitamin A.
* Pumpkin contains more than 5,000 mcg of beta-carotene, another 853 of alpha-carotene, and more than 3,500 mcg of beta-cryptoxanthin, a member of the carotenoid family that seems to reduce the risk of lung and colon cancer.
* Your Eyes Will Thank You Pumpkin has more than 2,400 mcg of the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, which are fast becoming the star nutrients in eye health and vision protection programs. 
* Pumpkin also has more than 12,000 IUs of vitamin A, plus a little bit of calcium, iron, magnesium, and phosphorus just for good measure.

### Purslane

* Purslane Highest in Omega-3s The real claim to fame of purslane as a health food is that its omega-3 concentration is the highest of any green leafy vegetable.
* It also has Calcium, Potassium, and Vitamin A.### Spinach

* Calorie for calorie, green leafy vegetables like spinach provide more nutrients than almost any other food on the planet. Spinach is loaded with vitamins and is one of the best sources of vitamin K.
* Great Alternative to Milk for Vitamin C Speaking of calcium, spinach is a fine source of calcium and a great alternative to dairy for people who don’t want to drink milk. It’s also got vitamin A, manganese, folic acid, magnesium, iron, vitamin C, and a powerful anti-inflammatory compound called quercetin.
* Sharp Minds for Spinach Eaters Spinach can also help prevent colon cancer because its vitamin C and beta- carotene help protect the colon cells from the damaging effects of free radicals. Those vitamins also help reduce inflammation, and may help protect the brain from the kinds of age-related declines we often see in brain function.
* Spinach is a great source of iron. 
* Finally, spinach contains lutein, a carotenoid that protects against eye disease and vision loss, like the kind caused by cataracts and macular degeneration.
* > Spinach on its 2003 list of twelve foods most contaminated with pesticides.So organic is recommended.

### Squash

* Summer and Winter Squash Go Head to Head Like most vegetables, summer squash is high in the heart-healthy mineral potassium. 
*  There’s also a decent amount of vitamin A, and beta-carotene,* Squash Can Help with Weight Loss One of the good things about squash in general is that it has a high water content.

### Sweet Potatos

* As starchy vegetables go, this is probably my absolute favorite.
* This starchy carbohydrate is high in fiber (half of which is soluble) and a rich source of powerful antioxidants in the carotenoid family, especially beta-carotene. Sweet potatoes are loaded with vitamin A and heart-healthy potassium, and they even have a dollop of calcium.
*  Finally, sweet potatoes contain other phytochemicals like quercetin, a powerful anti-inflammatory, and chlorogenic acid, an antioxidant.

### Swiss Chard

* Swiss chard is an excellent example of a nutritional powerhouse that delivers the goods for almost no calories.
* It has lots of fiber, Calcium, an incredible amount of potassium, and  vitamin C, vitamin A,
* > Swiss chard—like spinach, beets, rhubarb, and some other foods—does contain oxalates, which are not a concern for most people, but may be for those who have one type of kidney stones. Calcium oxalate kidney stones can result from excessive oxalates being absorbed through the gut and then binding with calcium in the urine and precipitating out to form the stones.

### Tomatoes

* Tomatoes cooked with oil, are a rich source of the carotenoid lycopene.  Lycopene is associated with significant reduction in prostate cancer.* Lycopene protects against lung and stomach cancers as well, and preliminary research shows protection against pancreatic, colorectal, esophageal, oral, breast, and cervical cancers.
* one study showed that treatment with antioxidant-rich tomato extract can reduce blood pressure in patients with grade 1 hypertension.
* The anticancer properties of lycopene are especially beneficial when consumed with fat-rich foods, such as avocado, olive oil, or nuts.
* Tomatoes also have a compound in them called lutein, which is really important for eye health
* You’re really best off buying tomatoes from local farmers and getting vine ripened whenever possible. They taste a lot better.
* > Tomatoes are usually avoided by people with GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) as well.

### Turnips

* Turnips belong to the genus Brassica (cabbage), members of which are so widely acclaimed for their cancer-fighting indoles and isothiocyanates and other health-giving phytochemicals.
* Turnip Greens Promote Bone Health Turnips are another of those “high-volume” foods that fill you up without costing you a lot of calories. 
* It has fiber, potassium, vitamin C, calcium, Vitamin Am beta-carotene.                
### Watercress

* Watercress Contains Four Times the Calcium of Milk
* This little plant contains as much vitamin C as oranges and more iron than spinach.
* It contains Vitamin A, C, K. eye nutrition, lutein and zeaxan-thin.

## Grains

Eight cereal grains (wheat, corn, rice, barley, sorghum, oats, rye, and millet) now provide 56 percent of the calories and 50 percent of the protein consumed on earth. Without these crops, the planet could not support six billion people. Grains Allow Modern Civilization to Flourish. 

### Does grains provide good nutrients?

It’s finally becoming accepted wisdom that the refined grains—which constitute most of our cereals, pastas, and breads—are absolutely useless nutritionally, but I’m not 100 percent sure so-called “whole” grains are light years better. One reason is that no grain can be eaten in a completely unrefined state. No one plucks wheat from the ground and starts eating. All grains by definition have to be milled and ground to some degree, one reason being that in their natural state they contain many “antinutrients,” substances (like phytates) that interfere with the absorption and assimilation of nutrients in the grain, especially minerals.

### Impact to blood sugar levels

* While the urban legend is that “whole grains” raise blood sugar much more slowly than their refined cousins, an examination of the glycemic index and glycemic load tables shows this is not always the case.
* Brown rice and white rice have virtually the same glycemic impact. So do “whole wheat” and white bread. Grains, by and large, are starch juggernauts and almost all of them raise blood sugar (and insulin) quickly.

#### Chosing best grains

#### Oatmeal

* Oats are simply a great source of fiber and contain a nice mix of both essential kinds (55 percent soluble and 45 percent insoluble).
* Oatmeal Turbocharges Your Immune System.
* Oatmeal Has More Protein Than Any Popular Cereal.
* >  The type of oatmeal you buy makes all the difference in the world. Forget about the instant packs; they are not even in the ball game. They’re usually sweetened, making their potential benefits for diabetics disappear. The less processing, the higher the fiber, the lower the glycemic load (sugar impact), and the better the oatmeal is for you.

#### Quinoa

* Quinoa is a highly nutritious food and is considered a high-protein “grain.” The protein quality and quantity in quinoa seed is often superior to those of more common cereal grains.
* Quinoa has a lower sodium content and is higher in calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, copper, manganese, and zinc than wheat, barley, or corn. It’s particularly high in iron.

#### White Rice vs Brown Rice

* Brown rice is the entire grain of rice, while white rice has had the bran layer removed. Stripping the grain of its bran layer strips it of a majority of its fiber content along with many of its vitamins and minerals. Since brown rice only has the outer hull removed, it retains such nutrients as niacin, vitamin B6, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, selenium, and even some vitamin E.

* >  If you eat rice, stick with whole grain. Forget about white. Consider using rice as a small side dish, about the size of an ice cream scoop.

### What’s the best advice?

> Let’s put it this way: If you ate a great balance of foods from the 150 that make up the list of the healthiest foods on the planet, and you never touched a grain for the rest of your life, you wouldn’t be missing anything nutritionally. The same cannot be said of the fruits, vegetables, eggs, oils, spices, meat, fish, and poultry.

##  Beans and Legumes

### Beans

* They lower cholesterol. A cup of cooked beans a day can lower your total cholesterol by up to 10 percent in a mere six weeks.
* They’re loaded with protective phytochemicals, antioxidants, and vitamins.
* Beans are the ultimate low-glycemic food. Their high fiber content means they raise blood sugar very, very slowly, and eating high-fiber foods like beans has been shown in a number of studies to improve what’s called “glycemic control”—the regulation of blood sugar and insulin.
* Researchers found a significant reduced frequency of breast cancer in those women who consumed a higher intake of common beans or lentils.
* They’re loaded with antioxidants. The USDA’s ranking of foods by antioxidant capacity lists small dried red beans as having the highest antioxidant capacity per serving size of any food tested; in fact, of the four top- scoring foods, three were beans (red beans, red kidney beans, and pinto beans). Many bean varieties have a lot of folic acid (especially adzukis, black-eyed peas, lentils, and pinto beans),
* Beans are also a good source of protein, typically containing 15 g per cup. And unlike most commercial animal protein sources, they don’t come with any steroids, hormones, or antibiotics.
* > Beans lower risks of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer. 

### Garbanzo Beans (chickpeas)

* Chickpeas belong to the class of food called legumes or pulses, which also includes beans, lentils, and peas. Eating more legumes can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.
* They are highest in fiber content. 
* Chickpeas also have calcium and magnesium in a great 1:1 ratio, a decent amount of folate, and a ton of heart- healthy potassium

### Green Peas

* Peas Are Packed with Vitamins A and K
* Peas are a little high in sugar as legumes (or vegetables) go, but that’s balanced by the fact that it has great amount of fiber. Peas also have 42 percent of the Daily Value for vitamin A.
* They also have very good amount of protien.

### Lentils

* Lentils are distinguished from beans in that they don’t contain sulfur and therefore don’t produce gas.
* Lentils are loaded with high soluble fibre. Soluble fiber helps control blood sugar by delaying the emptying of the stomach and retarding the entry of sugar into the bloodstream.
* A cup of lentils contains a nice amount of protein—about 18 g. But best of all, that same cup contains a whopping 16 g of fiber. Lentils are also a terrific source of folate and a good source of at least seven minerals.manganese, an important trace mineral that’s essential for growth, reproduction, wound healing, peak brain function, and the proper metabolism of sugars, insulin, and cholesterol.
* Lentits that have their outer skin removed has lower nutritional value, especially the fiber content.
