3. The more plant foods, the better. 
4. **Eat less sugar. **And eat fewer foods that convert quickly to sugar in the body (read: almost all processed carbohydrates)
5. **Eat Real food**—whole food with minimal processing— contains a virtual pharmacy of nutrients, phytochemicals, enzymes, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, anti- inflammatories, and healthful fats, and can keep you alive and thriving into your tenth decade.
