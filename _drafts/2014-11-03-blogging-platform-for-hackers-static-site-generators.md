When I decided to blog, I researched on next generation blogging platforms for hackers. Mainstream blogging platforms 
like wordpress, blogger, tumblr are designed for naive users and aren't best for developers. Because those platforms
doesn't support lot of features programmers would want like code syntax highlighting, theming using popular css framework, 
markdown language support, integration with source code repositories etc.
