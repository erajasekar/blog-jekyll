I read inspiring story on Nikola Tesla from book [Awakening your inner genius](http://amzn.com/1938895150). Nikola Tesla
is a greatest genius who invented the electronic age of twentieth century.  His inventions, patents, and theoretical work formed the basis of modern AC electricity, 
and contributed to the development of radio and television. I feel his story is important for anyone interested in history of invention.

##Why Nikola Tesla is Great Genius?
 
If you think about genius behind the lamp (first invention of electronic age), most people appreciate  **Thomas Alva Edison** . 
But visionary named **Nikola Tesla** was the major contributor to the electrical revolution that transformed daily life at the turn of the twentieth century.
He invented the **Alternative Current** and system for generating electricity and distributing it households. 
Most of us still believe **Guglielmo Marconi** to be inventor of **Radio**, but everything he did was based on Tesla's work.
In 1943, when it was proven that Tesla invented the radio years previous to Marconi, the Supreme Court overturned Marconi's patent.
Tesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions. Many of the modern electronic things like Electric Motor, Remote Control, Wireless Communications , Robotics were invented and demonstrated by Tesla long before they were commercialized.

So with this incredible mind and all these inventions behind him, Tesla should have been rich and famous, right?
Unfortunately, no. Tesla lived in a time when the world demanded results that were practical and profitable. 
Unlike Edison he could not commercialize his inventions.
