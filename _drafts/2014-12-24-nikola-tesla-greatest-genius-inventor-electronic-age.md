I read inspiring story on Nikola Tesla from book [Awakening your inner genius](http://amzn.com/1938895150). **Nikola Tesla**
is a greatest genius who invented the electronic age of twentieth century.  His inventions, patents, and theoretical work formed the basis of modern AC electricity, 
and contributed to the development of radio, television and many electrical items. I feel his story is important for anyone interested in history of invention.

##Why Nikola Tesla is Great Genius?
 
If you think about genius behind the lamp (first invention of electronic age), most people appreciate [Thomas Alva Edison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison) . 
But visionary named [Nikola Tesla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla) was the major contributor to the electrical revolution that transformed daily life at the turn of the twentieth century.
He invented the **Alternative Current** and system for generating electricity and distributing it households. 

Most of us still believe **Guglielmo Marconi** to be inventor of **Radio**, but everything he did was based on Tesla's work.
Few months after Tesla died in 1943, the Supreme Court overturned Marconi's patent and declared Tesla as inventor or Radio.

Tesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions. Many of the modern electronic things like Electric Motor, Remote Control, Wireless Communications , Robotics were invented and demonstrated by Tesla long before they were commercialized.

So with this incredible mind and all these inventions behind him, Tesla should have been rich and famous, right?
Unfortunately, no. Tesla lived in a time when the world demanded results that were practical and profitable. 
Unlike Edison he could not commercialize his inventions. So he died penniless and alone at New Yorker Hotel.

The year was 1882. Only two years earlier, Edison had patented a system for electricity distribution using direct current generators, which produced a flow of electricity in one direction. Edison’s breakthrough was a modern miracle despite having serious limitations. Namely, the generators had no efficient way to change the voltage of direct current circuits, so generation plants could only serve customers within a two-mile radius. Thus, it was unlikely that this form of electricity would ever be available

A year later, Tesla was in Strasbourg, France to repair a railway lighting system. He made the necessary repairs, but that wasn’t all he did. He built the first prototype of his visionary alternating current motor, which worked exactly as he had conceived it in his mind. His own miracle in-hand , Tesla immediately courted investors for his radical device. One by one, wealthy businessmen that couldn’t understand the device and didn’t see the commercial value in it rejected him. Tesla was undaunted. He concluded that the only way he could realize his motor was to meet the world’s greatest electrical engineer, Thomas Edison, directly.

Direct current was barely a decade old when Tesla shook hands with Edison. His distribution network in Manhattan was not only immensely profitable, but it was the only option if you wanted electricity. So, when Tesla explained that alternating current would be the future of electricity, Edison dismissed it as fanciful and unnecessary. Direct current was getting the job done, people liked it, and it was making Edison and his financier, J.P. Morgan, exorbitant sums of money. In Edison’s eyes, anything that challenged it was seen not as a praiseworthy advancement of science and industry, but a threat. Despite his monopolistic perspective , Edison liked Tesla and hired him on the spot to work with his electrical engineers. Tesla’s work began with simple tasks such as repairing lighting systems , but within several months, he was one of Edison’s most valuable engineers, and was solving some of the company’s most difficult problems. Edison referred to him as a “damn good man.” In 1885, Tesla informed Edison that he could greatly improve his direct current generators by redesigning key elements. Edison thought it impossible and promised Tesla $ 50,000 if he could deliver on his claims. Tesla worked tirelessly for the better part of a year to improve the generators, installing parts of his own design. Once completed, his generators were a vast improvement over Edison’s. They were far more efficient and durable, and thus far more profitable. Edison was thoroughly impressed, but when Tesla asked to be paid, Edison laughed and claimed he was only joking about the reward.
“Tesla, you don’t understand our American humor,” he said. Instead, Edison offered Tesla a raise of $ 10 more per week, to be added to his current salary of $ 18 per week. Tesla was disgusted and immediately resigned. This was the beginning of a lifelong feud between these two great inventors— one that Edison would later lament as his “greatest mistake.”

Two men approached Tesla— Alfred Brown, director of Western Union, and Charles Peck, a New York City attorney— in 1887 to learn more about his alternating current theories and designs.
The men were impressed and agreed to invest in the project. They set up Telsa with a small laboratory close to Edison’s office, where he quickly developed all the necessary components for the system.

In November 1887, Tesla filed for seven U.S. patents for his inventions, which were so original that they were issued without challenge. These patents comprised a complete system of generators, transformers, transmission lines, motors, and lighting. They would become the most valuable patents since the telephone. In accordance with their agreement, Tesla split the ownership of the patents on a fifty-fifty basis with his investors.

He had a dream of providing electricity throughout the entire United States, and he believed that alternating current was the future of electrical generation and long-distance transmission.

Westinghouse visited Tesla’s lab and made an offer for his patents: $ 25,000 in cash, $ 50,000 in stock in his company, and a royalty of $ 2.50 per horsepower of alternating current motors sold. The terms were more than acceptable— if his motors were going to be as successful as he and Westinghouse envisioned, the royalties alone would make him one of the richest man in the world.

Edison and Morgan launched a full-scale propaganda assault against alternating current. Edison knew that direct current would have to stamp out alternating current to survive. More personally , he was heavily invested both financially and emotionally in his direct current network of generators and distribution lines. Edison declared publicly that alternating current delivered to a home would kill a customer within six months . Leaflets about the dangers of alternating current were distributed. Lobbying efforts were made in New York to limit levels of electricity to 800 volts “as a matter of public safety,” which would conveniently make long-distance alternating current transmission impossible. Edison’s efforts then took a turn for the grisly. He began holding weekend demonstrations of the hazards of Tesla’s work by electrocuting animals found roaming the streets. He directed two technicians to do the same, including the execution of cattle and horses.

In this we can see the necessity of being willing to fight for your creations. Morgan and Edison weren’t satisfied with trying to ruin Tesla through capitalistic competition— they were resorting to outright depravity and dishonesty. Imagine the pressure Tesla faced: both the world’s most powerful financier— one of the last enemies you’d want— and the world’s greatest inventor were trying to draw a bead on him and pull the trigger. Most men would’ve quietly resigned, or begged for scraps, but not Tesla.

The first milestone in this new research was Tesla’s invention of what became known as the “Tesla coil.” It was a device that took normal sixty-cycle -per-second alternating current electricity and stepped it up to an ultra-high frequency of hundreds-of-thousands of cycles per second, and extremely high voltages. Tesla used his coil to invent the first high-efficiency, high-frequency fluorescent lamp. This discovery pales in comparison to what he uncovered next, however. In 1891, in his New York City lab, Tesla proved that energy could be transmitted through the air by wirelessly lighting lamps. This discovery fascinated Tesla, sparking his lifelong obsession with wireless energy. He immediately envisioned a network of transmission stations that would provide free, wireless energy to not only the United States, but the world. His coils helped him discover yet another phenomenon that would change the world: radio waves. When Tesla tuned two coils to resonate at the same frequency, he found that he could send and receive signals. He had accidentally built the first radio transmitter and made the first transmissions, methods he would patent within two years.

 Edison’s gruesome stunts and vigorous propaganda campaign were driving wave after wave of negative press, but alternating current won an opportunity to once and for all prove its value. The Westinghouse Corporation won a bid for illuminating the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair,
 On the evening of May 1, 1893, over 27 million people anxiously awaited to see the future of electricity. When President Grover Cleveland pushed a button , over 100,000 lamps, wired to 12 new thousand -horsepower alternating current generators , turned night to day. Attendees looked on in awe, dubbing the wonder the “City of Light.”

Within a week, the entire nation was raving about alternating current as the future of electricity.Westinghouse was contacted late in 1893 by the Niagara Falls Commission, which had been charged with developing a power plant that would harness the force of the falls.

A year later, the Niagara power plant was ready for operation . When the switch was thrown, all worries and anxieties melted. The first power reached Buffalo at midnight November 16, 1896, nearly 22 miles away. Plans were immediately set in motion to power all of New York City with the station. Tesla was praised worldwide as a hero, and was referred to as the “Wizard of the West.” Morgan, who controlled Edison’s direct current patents, was now fully convinced that alternating current had defeated Edison’s work. He approached Westinghouse to strike a deal. Morgan didn’t care what kind of electricity was used in the world, as long as he controlled it.

Edison’s monopoly by bribing local politicians and installing systems that are too expensive to change. The same could be done for Westinghouse and alternating current, Coffin claimed. Westinghouse rebuffed Morgan’s offers and made it clear that their styles of business weren’t compatible.

Morgan then began an attack through stock manipulation, and moved to gain control of The Westinghouse Corporation, and thus Tesla’s patents. By the end of 1897, Westinghouse was nearly bankrupt, and it looked as though Morgan would usurp everything that Tesla and Westinghouse had built together. Westinghouse owed Tesla over $ 1 million in royalties, an amount that grew daily. When Westinghouse described to Tesla the desperate situation, Tesla replied with the following: “Mr. Westinghouse , you have been my friend, you believed in me when others had no faith; you were brave enough to go ahead when others lacked courage; you supported me when even your own engineers lacked vision. … Here is your contract, and here is my contract. I will tear them both to pieces, and you will no longer have any troubles from my royalties.” In time, these royalties would’ve made Tesla the world’s first billionaire. Instead, they enabled Westinghouse to save his company. Tesla’s selflessness was a testament not only to his generosity and goodwill, but his belief in his ability to continue to create his future. He was certain that his best work still lay ahead of him, and that he would soon invent machines that would dwarf everything that he had accomplished thus far.

In 1898, Tesla announced his latest invention: a way to remotely control machines with radio technology. Skepticism was widely expressed and quickly diffused thanks to his Madison Square Garden demonstration of remotely driving a small metal boat through an indoor pond . Many spectators believed that he was somehow controlling the boat with his mind.

The brand new use of radio technology could be used for many things, Tesla said. He envisioned one or several operators directing scores of vessels or machines through radio transmitters and receivers tuned to different frequencies. When a New York Times writer suggested that Tesla’s discovery could be used in war to create a remote-controlled torpedo, Tesla quickly refuted him, “You do not see there a wireless torpedo, you see there the first of a race of robots, mechanical men which will do the laborious work of the human race.”

Morgan offered to fund the construction of the power plant and transmission tower necessary to pursue Tesla’s fantastical claims. One would think that Tesla would balk at any offerings of Morgan’s as he clearly couldn’t be trusted— he was one of the driving forces behind the propaganda used against Tesla in the War of the Currents. And just three years earlier, Morgan maneuvered to steal Westinghouse’s company, costing Tesla his lucrative royalty agreement. Nevertheless, Tesla chose to partner with Morgan, a decision that would prove to be the biggest mistake of his life.

Last-minute design changes were required, however, necessitating more money. Tesla had already obtained a second loan from Morgan, and when those funds ran out, he again approached the financier for additional capital. In an attempt to convince the powerful Morgan to invest another large sum, Tesla explained that the tower could be used for more than transmitting radio signals— it could be used to saturate the entire globe with electricity harmless to living things so that everyone could obtain usable power by simply sticking wires in the soil. Morgan considered Tesla’s words carefully and coldly replied, “If anyone can draw on the power, where do we put the meter?” He refused Tesla’s pleadings for more money, forcing Tesla to use his own funds, which he knew to be insufficient to complete the project.

Only months later, in 1904, the U.S. Patent Office stripped Tesla of his radio patents and awarded them to the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi, instead. Marconi had used radio technology pioneered by Tesla 11 years earlier to transmit the letter “s” in morse code over 2,000 miles, which gave him no claim to the patents, of course. What did give him claim, though? He had the financial backing of Morgan, Edison, and steel baron Andrew Carnegie, all of whom held sway in every level of government.

Marconi was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1911 for his “achievements” in radio, and was hailed as the “father of radio.” Tesla was infuriated and, in 1915, sued Marconi for infringement on his patents. He didn’t have the money to take on the flush Marconi, however, and the suit was dismissed. In the same year, it was announced that Tesla and Edison were potential laureates to share the Nobel Prize of 1915 . Both men refused to accept the award together, or separately if the other were to receive it first.
