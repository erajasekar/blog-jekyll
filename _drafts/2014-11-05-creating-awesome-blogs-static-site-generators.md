When I decided to blog, I researched on next generation blogging platforms for hackers. 
Mainstream blogging platforms like wordpress, blogger, tumblr are designed for naive users and aren't best for developers. 
Because those platforms doesn't support features programmers would want like code syntax highlighting, theming using popular css frameworks, 
markdown language support, integration with source code repositories etc. <!-- TODO bulletize -->

###Static site generators:
I learned that static site generators are used as blogging platform. The static site generators are basically template engines 
that takes templated dynamic content and runs it through various processors and converters to generate static html pages. 
The idea that dynamic content doesn't need to be always served by a backend server, rather a template engine could pre generate 
static site from dynamic content is brilliant. Using static site generators provided following features which I was looking for

+ Syntax highlighting for code snippets.
+ Customizable layouts and themes using css frameworks like Bootstrap
+ Write content using Markdown language.
+ Manage code in source control.
+ Easy deployment and hosting on github pages or other hosting providers like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
+ Easy integration with social sharing like facebook, twitter and disqus comments.
 
After bit of research narrowed down my choices to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
and [Docpad](https://docpad.org/)

###First impressions with Octopress

Octopress advertises itself as **A blogging framework for hackers.** 

###Experience with Docpad


I found that many static site generators were popularly used for blogging. After bit of googling, I narrowed it down to octopress or docpad.
