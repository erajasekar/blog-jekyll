I got wonderful opportunity to participate in great american teach-in at Morgan woods elementary school, Tampa. 
I did presentation on ***introduction to programming*** to 3rd to 5th grade students.
In this post, I will share by experiences on talking to kids about programming and discussions I had with them.

###Preparation

The invitation letter from school stated that *"share with students something about your career, your experiences, your hobby, or yourself"*.
<br>
Soon I learnt that, these talks should be informative but not too lecture-y and be something that  hopefully will hold the kids interest for the 15 or 20 minutes.
They want to hear about what people do in ***real life*** and what sorts of talents and skills might be required to do that themselves.
People from all walks of life will present on teach-in from lawn maintenance workers to professional sportsmen. 
So I decided that I should talk about programming and try to generate interest in software programming at least to some of the kids.
 
I searched web and found very good tips from this [stackoverflow answers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2455786/career-day-in-kindergarten-how-to-demonstrate-programming-in-20-minutes).
Then I prepared these slides:
<iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41810550?startSlide=2" width="595" height="485" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe> 

I wasn't sure which graders I would be talking too, so as a backup I included additional slides with highlights from 
*The Five Elements of Effective Thinking* [Book](http://amzn.com/0691156662) and *How children succeed? article* I [posted before]({% post_url 2014-10-30-how-children-succeed %}).
I thought If I get to meet with older students, they might already know some stuff about programming, so I can skim to programming slides quickly and talk about these additional stuff.
 

###Presentation Day
####Schedule
I was requested to come in between 12pm to 2pm on the day of the presentation. I was scheduled
for three sessions 12-12:30pm, 1-1:30pm. 1:30-2pm with 5th grade, 3rd grade and 4th grade students respectively.


####Presentation
Here is transcript of actual talk I presented to students.

######[Slide 1](http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41810550?startSlide=1) : Greeting

> I am Rajasekar Elango. How is everyone?
	
######[Slide 2](http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41810550?startSlide=2) : Introduction

> I am a Software Developer at Salesforce.com. We deliver *Customer Relationship Management* (CRM) products on the cloud. ***CRM*** is a system for managing a company's interactions with current and future customers. 

>We have laptop from HP here. If there is some problem with this laptop and you call support, they will use CRM software to track all the information. When you call them again, they can pull up history of all the conversation you had with them earlier.

> Also, a sales or marketting agent meets lots of potential customers to demo their production; They will use a CRM software to save all the information about customers like their contact numbers, email etc. This will help them to easily follow up with customers to check if they are interested in purchasing the product.

> CRM is also used to store exisiting customer information. For eg. by knowing customer's date of birth, company can send a birthday wishes to their customer which can improve their relationship with customers.

	
######[Slide 3](http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41810550?startSlide=3) : Are Computers Smart?

> I asked, How many of you think computers are smarts..? Many students raised their hands and I asked couple of them why they think computers are smart. 

>One student said *"I can find anything from internet, it knows everything"*, another said *"It remembers all web sites used before"*. One smart kid in 5th grade said *"Computers are not smarts, only humans are smart. we have to tell it everything to do"*.

> (I said exactly and continued with next slide)

######[Slide 4](http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41810550?startSlide=4) : What is Computer Programming?

> *Computers are really stupid but fast.* (this triggered huge laughter in 5th grade class). *Humans is smart, but slow.* If I ask you to do mutiplication of two four digit numbers, you might need more that two minutes, but computers can do in nano seconds.

> ***Programming is the act of taking complicated human ideas and breaking them down into simple enough instructions that a computer can understand and follow.*** Then the computer can perform your idea super-fast for you.
 
> It can also repeat it many times. For eg. If I ask you to do multiplication all day long, you will be bored. But once you write a program to solve your problem, computers can repeat it over and over again.

######[Slide 5](http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41810550?startSlide=4) : Binary

> I just said computers are stupid, but the actual hardware - the chips inside computers can actually understand only 0's and 1's - binary. I asked, How many of you know what is GB or MB mean in iphone or computers? Few answered correctly. I continued,


> 1 Bit = Binary Digit <br/>
> 8 Bits = 1 Byte  <br/>
> 1024 Bytes = 1 Kilobyte <br/>
> 1024 Kilobytes = 1 Megabyte  <br/>
> 1024 Megabytes = 1 Gigabyte =1024*1024*1024*8 Bits or 8589934592 Bits

> So all the videos, music and textual information you see in computers are store as just 0's and 1's in hardware. Bytes or Gigabytes is unit for measuring memory just like pounds for weight, ounces for liquid etc.

######[Slide 6](http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41810550?startSlide=6) : How many of you like pets?

> I asked, How many of you like pets? Many raised their hands. I continued, 
> 
>  Once we learn to communicate with pets, once they can understand us, we can make them do whatever we want. In some way computers are like pets. Once we learn it's language we can make it do whatever we want ofcourse with some limitation.

######[Slide 7](http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41810550?startSlide=7) : Why I like programming?

> *I love making things for other people to use.* For eg. This powerpoint presentation was developed by some software engineer that is by millions of people.

> *I like solving puzzles.* It's like a puzzle before you have a solution. Once you find a solution, you will feel the pride of solving complex puzzle.

> *I like experimenting and research.* Software programming is like conducting experiments, you will try something, if it doesn't work scratch that off and try different approach. It's also like doing research, you have to search the web, read the documentation, refer the books to come up with solution.

	

####Q&A                 

###Feedback
 

-----

 just enthusiasm and a desire to share with students something about your career, your experiences, your hobby, or yourself.  We want you to carry some key messages into our classrooms, including the importance of staying in school and the value of each individual student.
 In general, these talks should be informative but not too lecture-y and be something that  hopefully will hold the kids interest for the 15 or 20 minutes. 
 They want to hear about what people do in "real life" and what sorts of talents and skills might be required to do that themselves (e.g interest on problem solving, math, college degree etc..). 
 Many kids may not know too much about what sorts of things grown-ups do for a living other than their parents.
 You get people from all walks of life going to these, from lawn maintenance workers to professional sportsmen,
 so there is no right answer on what to present, but ideally it would generate an interest in your job within at least some of the kids.
 
 Do whatever you want and whatever you feel comfortable with, but keep it light, and try to find something the kids can relate to, at least somewhat, if you want to keep their attention.
