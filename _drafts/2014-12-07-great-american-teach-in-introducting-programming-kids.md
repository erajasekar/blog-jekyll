I got wonderful opportunity to participate in great american teach-in at Morgan woods elementary school, Tampa. 
I did presentation on ***introduction to programming*** to 3rd to 5th grade students.
In this post, I will share by experiences on talking to kids about programming and discussions I had with them.

###Preparation

The invitation letter from school stated that *"share with students something about your career, your experiences, your hobby, or yourself"*.
<br>
Soon I learnt that, these talks should be informative but not too lecture-y and be something that  hopefully will hold the kids interest for the 15 or 20 minutes.
They want to hear about what people do in ***real life*** and what sorts of talents and skills might be required to do that themselves.
People from all walks of life will present on teach-in from lawn maintenance workers to professional sportsmen. 
So I decided that I should talk about programming and try to generate interest in software programming at least to some of the kids.
 
I searched web and found very good tips from this [stackoverflow answers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2455786/career-day-in-kindergarten-how-to-demonstrate-programming-in-20-minutes).
Then I prepared these slides:
<iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41810550?startSlide=2" width="595" height="485" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe> 

I wasn't sure which graders I would be talking too, so as a backup I included additional slides with highlights from 
*The Five Elements of Effective Thinking* [Book](http://amzn.com/0691156662) and *How children succeed? article* I [posted before]({% post_url 2014-10-30-how-children-succeed %}).
I thought If I get to meet with older students, they might already know some stuff about programming, so I can skim to programming slides quickly and talk about these additional stuff.

 just enthusiasm and a desire to share with students something about your career, your experiences, your hobby, or yourself.  We want you to carry some key messages into our classrooms, including the importance of staying in school and the value of each individual student.
 In general, these talks should be informative but not too lecture-y and be something that  hopefully will hold the kids interest for the 15 or 20 minutes. 
 They want to hear about what people do in "real life" and what sorts of talents and skills might be required to do that themselves (e.g interest on problem solving, math, college degree etc..). 
 Many kids may not know too much about what sorts of things grown-ups do for a living other than their parents.
 You get people from all walks of life going to these, from lawn maintenance workers to professional sportsmen,
 so there is no right answer on what to present, but ideally it would generate an interest in your job within at least some of the kids.
 
 Do whatever you want and whatever you feel comfortable with, but keep it light, and try to find something the kids can relate to, at least somewhat, if you want to keep their attention.
