This is source code of my blog at [erajasekar.com ](http://erajasekar.com) hosted using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's build with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator using [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) theme.

I actually forked this from [anandmanisankar.com](http://anandmanisankar.com/) as he had all the social plugins configured like the way I wanted. Then I added my own customizations.

If you would like to build your own site, by using my blog as foundation, refer to this [post](http://erajasekar.com/posts/set-up-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).
